  I created couple of apps using Android Studio and some of external libraries like Retrofit
  
  AlarmApp - simple app for setting alarm clock to preffered hour 
  
  GymApp - not finished app where you can plan, manage, create, delete and much more with your gym activities lists
  
  ShopApp - creating, managing, adding, deleting, giving favourites to your products. Example app how online shop looks like
  
  ImageSliderApp - gallery app with four labels and couple images in each of them
  
  MyLibrary - searching for interesting books, reading descriptions about it and managing your cart
